The SQL file for database can be found here on google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1knqDgbrbk8bCVEJr0iDFvTDAT_GEs1JD/view?usp=sharing, it was made by exporting the database from a local database made with XAMPP. Download and import this database and connect to it locally to make sure it works first.
